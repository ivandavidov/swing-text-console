# swing-text-console

Set of Java Swing components and backing business classes which together behave like text console with enabled colors. The main idea is to 'embed' such a component in a Swing application and then use the 'console' to perform various console tasks.

The console component can easily be extended to support different types of console. Refer to the demo included with the sources for simple induction on how to use the components.
